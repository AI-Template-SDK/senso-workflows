  "Response": "The average interest rate for personal loans can vary depending on factors such as your credit score, loan amount, loan term, and the lender you choose. However, as of recent data (2023), here's a general breakdown:\n\n* **Excellent credit (740 and above):** 7% to 10%\n* **Good credit (700–739):** 10% to 15%\n* **Fair credit (640–699):** 15% to 20%\n* **Poor credit (below 640):** 20% to 36% (or higher)\n\nOn average, **personal loan interest rates** typically range between **6% and 36%**. Rates may be lower if you use a secured loan or have a strong credit history, but they can rise significantly for those with lower credit scores.\n\nIf you're shopping for personal loans, it's a good idea to compare offers from multiple lenders to find the best rate for your financial situation.",
