    "question": "What’s the easiest way to track how often I’m mentioned in AI",
    "response": "Tracking how often you’re mentioned in the context of AI can be straightforward with the right tools and approach. Here are the easiest ways, depending on what kind of mentions you want to track:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Google Alerts\nSet up a Google Alert for your name or relevant keywords.\n- How: Go to Google Alerts, enter your name (or business, or username), and add related AI keywords if needed.\n    - E.g. \"Your Name\" AND AI or \"Your Username\" AND artificial intelligence\n- You'll get email notifications when you’re mentioned on indexed web pages.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Social Media Monitoring Tools\nSeveral tools track mentions in real-time across social media and web:\n- Free options: \n    - Mention\n    - Talkwalker Alerts (similar to Google Alerts)\n- Paid/pro versions: \n    - Brand24\n    - Hootsuite\n\nYou just sign up, enter your name/keywords, and get alerts or a dashboard.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Search Your Name/Username Regularly\nSome places (like forums or closed platforms) aren’t well-covered by alerts:\n- Periodically Google your name + “AI”\n- Search Twitter/X, Reddit, LinkedIn, Discord, etc., manually or with their advanced search.\n\n---\n\n## 4. GitHub & Stack Overflow\nIf you contribute to AI projects:\n- Use GitHub’s notifications or search for your username plus AI repos.\n- Stack Overflow lets you set up “Watched Tags” and follow questions involving you or your expertise.\n\n---\n\n## 5. AI Tools Specific Monitoring\nSome newer platforms like Perplexity AI or Hugging Face let you set notifications for discussions, papers, or any time your profile/project is referenced.\n\n---\n\n### Tips for Better Results\n- Use unique strings (usernames, Twitter handles) to avoid noise.\n- Experiment with different keywords (e.g., “Your Name” + “AI researcher”).\n- If you want historical data, some paid tools offer full archives.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want help setting up a specific alert or have a particular site or context in mind!",
