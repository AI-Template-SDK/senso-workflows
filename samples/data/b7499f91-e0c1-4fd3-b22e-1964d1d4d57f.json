    "question": "What's the easiest way to track how often I'm mentioned in AI",
    "response": "The easiest way to track how often you're mentioned in AI-related contexts is to use **Google Alerts**. You can set up alerts for your name or specific keywords, and Google will email you whenever those terms are mentioned online.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can get started:\n\n1. Go to [Google Alerts](https://www.google.com/alerts).\n2. Enter your name, handle, or relevant keywords (e.g., \u201cYourName\u201d + \u201cAI\u201d) in the search box.\n3. Customize your alert settings (frequency, sources, language, etc.).\n4. Add your email address to receive notifications.\n\n**Bonus Tips:**\n- For social media tracking, tools like **Mention**, **Brand24**, or **TweetDeck** can give real-time notifications.\n- If you want to monitor academic citations, try **Google Scholar Alerts**.\n\nWould you like more methods specific to forums, social media, or news sites?",
