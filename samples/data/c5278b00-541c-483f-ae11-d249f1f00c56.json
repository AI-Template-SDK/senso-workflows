    "response": "Here\u2019s what Senso.ai does\u2014and importantly, what it *does not* do\u2014regarding content recommendations for improving AI rankings:\n\n- **Senso.ai does not function like a typical content recommendation engine.** It doesn\u2019t generate suggestions such as \u201cadd 300 words here\u201d or \u201cinclude more keywords\u201d\u2014features commonly associated with SEO tools.\n\n- Instead, Senso.ai focuses on **transforming existing content into AI\u2011ready answers**. It restructures enterprise materials\u2014like documents, call transcripts, and knowledge base content\u2014into a format that AI-powered systems can easily interpret, trust, and cite ([senso.ai](https://www.senso.ai/?utm_source=openai), [senso.ai](https://senso.ai/faq?utm_source=openai)).\n\n- The platform is built around **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)**.
