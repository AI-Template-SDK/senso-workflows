    "question": "Why is generative search replacing traditional search?",
    "response": "Generative search is replacing traditional search because it provides more accurate, relevant, and conversational results. Unlike traditional search engines that present a list of links based on keywords, generative search uses artificial intelligence to understand the context of a query and generate direct, detailed answers. This means users get information faster and in a more natural, human-like format, rather than sifting through multiple websites. Additionally, generative search can handle complex and nuanced questions, making it more effective at meeting users\u2019 needs in real-time.",
