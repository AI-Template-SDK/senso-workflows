    "question": "What's the role of trust and accuracy in AI-generated answers?",
    "response": "Trust and accuracy are fundamental to AI-generated answers. **Trust** refers to users\u2019 confidence that the AI provides reliable, unbiased, and ethical responses. If people trust the AI, they are more likely to use and act on its recommendations. **Accuracy** means the information presented by the AI is correct, factual, and precise. High accuracy ensures that users receive information that genuinely represents reality.\n\nBoth trust and accuracy are deeply interconnected. If an AI consistently produces accurate answers, users will develop greater trust in it. Conversely, if the AI distributes misinformation or makes frequent mistakes, trust will diminish, which can limit its usefulness and adoption. Thus, ensuring AI systems deliver accurate information and building mechanisms to foster trust are essential for the responsible and effective use of AI technologies.",
