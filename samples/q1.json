    "question": "What does Senso.ai do?",
    "response": "Here’s what Senso.ai does, based on recent, reliable sources:\n\nSenso.ai is an AI-driven knowledge platform aimed at helping enterprises—particularly in financial services like credit unions—transform their content into accurate, trusted responses optimized for AI tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Google's Gemini (senso.ai).\n\n### Core Capabilities\n\n- Content Ingestion & Structuring: Senso ingests enterprise content—websites, internal documents, call transcripts, customer chats—and reshapes it into high-quality, LLM-ready answers. This enables businesses to improve visibility across AI-powered search platforms and deliver consistent messaging (senso.ai, senso.ai).\n\n- Operational Efficiency: By leveraging tools like their “Agent Fetch” and “Agent Echo,” Senso extracts insights from unstructured content (e.g., policy documents, support transcripts) to populate and maintain a knowledge base that improves service response times, answer consistency, and content quality (senso.ai).\n\n- Brand Visibility in AI Search: The platform acts as a “Generative Engine Optimization” layer, helping brands ensure their messaging is visible, authoritative, and consistent across multiple AI platforms (senso.ai).\n\n### Industry Usage\n\n- Credit Unions & Financial Services: Senso originated with a focus on the credit union space, offering significant improvements in support efficiency—e.g., drastically faster document retrieval and reduced member query handling time (ycombinator.com, senso.ai).\n\n- Consortium-Based Solution – “CUCopilot”: In collaboration with CU 2.0, in mid‑2023, Senso launched “CUCopilot”—a generative AI-powered solution tailored for credit unions. It enables rapid access to institutional knowledge, reduces wait times, highlights policy gaps, and fosters shared innovation among participating institutions (cu-2.com, cuinsight.com).\n\n### More Recent Developments (2025)\n\n- First Agent Tool Launch (Jan. 2025): Senso introduced “First Agent,” a tool designed to help organizations quickly deploy their first AI conversational agent—transforming their website into a voice- and chat-enabled support agent. This product also includes a free AI-readiness assessment, measuring “Response Quality” and outlining knowledge gaps to enhance agent performance (cuinsight.com).\n\n---\n\nIn summary, Senso.ai helps organizations:\n\n- Convert vast amounts of unstructured content into structured, AI‑friendly knowledge.\n- Improve customer and staff experiences through faster, more consistent responses.\n- Optimize brand visibility across AI tools.\n- Offer tailored solutions for financial entities (e.g., CUCopilot).\n- Help organizations launch AI conversational agents effectively and efficiently.\n\nIf you'd like details on deployment, pricing, or technical integration, feel free to ask!",
