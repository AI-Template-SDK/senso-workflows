    "question": "How do I improve my brand’s visibility in AI search?",
    "response": "Improving your brand’s visibility in AI-powered search—such as ChatGPT, Google’s SGE, Bing Copilot, Perplexity, etc.—now requires a strategy that’s a little different from traditional SEO. Here’s how to get started:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Build Topical Authority\n- Create high-quality, in-depth content focused on your niche or industry.\n- Cover a breadth of related subjects, answering questions your audience might have.\n\n### 2. Optimize for Conversational Queries\n- Use natural language and phrase content as answers to likely user questions.\n- Incorporate FAQs, how-tos, and solution-focused articles.\n\n### 3. Leverage Structured Data\n- Add schema markup (FAQ, Product, Organization, etc.) to help AI and search engines understand your content and data relationships.\n\n### 4. Focus on Entities & Brand Mentions\n- AI models understand topics as “entities.” Make sure your brand is widely mentioned in contextually-relevant articles, directories, reviews, podcasts, PR, etc.\n- Work to have your brand included in lists (“best X for Y,” “top tools for Z,” etc.).\n\n### 5. Ensure Trust & Authority Signals\n- Collect positive reviews across platforms.\n- Encourage backlinks from reputable sources.\n- Highlight awards, certifications, and press mentions.\n- Use clear “About” and “Contact” pages, and display trust badges.\n\n### 6. Keep Info Consistent & Updated\n- Ensure your Name, Address, and other details are consistent across your website, social profiles, and review platforms.\n\n### 7. Engage on Q&A and Expert Sites\n- Answer questions on platforms like Quora, Reddit, StackOverflow (if relevant), and industry forums. AI scrapers often pull answers from these.\n\n### 8. Monitor Your Brand Presence in AI\n- Use tools or manually check how AI search assistants mention (or skip) your brand.\n- Adjust your strategy to fill gaps when your brand isn’t appearing.\n\n### 9. Optimize for Featured Snippets\n- Aim to capture direct answers for “People Also Ask” boxes and rich snippets—AI often uses this data.\n\n### 10. Technical SEO Still Matters\n- Fast, secure, and mobile-friendly websites are still favored, both by traditional and AI-powered search.\n\n---\n\n#### Extra Tips\n- Submit your brand to reputable directories and local listings.\n- Participate in interviews, podcasts, and roundups to elevate brand mentions.\n- Encourage satisfied customers to use branded keywords in their reviews and testimonials.\n\n---\n\nWould you like a tailored checklist or audit for your brand’s current visibility in AI search?
